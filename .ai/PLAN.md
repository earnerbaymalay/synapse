## Phase 3 — Core Engine: adapters + projection → GATE 2 (human)
- [x] T3.1  Adapter-smith swarm: 12 adapters, detect/import/project + round-trip :: verify: 12/12 round-trip green
- [x] T3.2  Projection engine: symlink-vs-generate policy table, mappings.json, drift detector :: verify: policy table present and tested
- [x] T3.3  Red-team pass: symlink escape, path traversal, circular links, malformed configs :: verify: red-team report in docs/security.md
- [x] T3.4  Gate 2: human runs cli scan && cli import --dry-run on real machine and approves

## Phase 4 — Sync Daemon & Time Machine
- [x] T4.1  Filesystem watcher (debounced) + OS scheduler registration :: verify: watcher test passes
- [x] T4.2  Conflict queue API + three-way merge :: verify: conflict fixture test
- [x] T4.3  Git snapshot/rollback commands + crash-safe lock :: verify: rollback byte-identical test

## Phase 5 — GUI → GATE 3 (human)

## Phase 7 — Hardening, Docs, Self-Update
- [x] T7.1  Threat-model pass + red-team sign-off :: verify: docs/security.md sign-off
- [x] T7.2  Doctor rules library (≥12 diagnoses) :: verify: doctor fixes seeded faults
- [x] T7.3  Auto-update channel dry-run :: verify: updater test
- [x] T7.4  Doc set: README, user guide, adapter-authoring guide, CHANGELOG :: verify: docs build

## Phase 8 — Package & Release → GATE 4 (human)
- [ ] T8.1  Signed installers .dmg/.msi/AppImage/.deb + CLI formulae drafts :: verify: smoke-test install matrix
  - Actually shipped: unsigned `.deb`/`.AppImage` via `scripts/build-installers.sh`. No macOS/Windows bundling, no code signing, no CLI install scripts or Homebrew formula exist — see docs/packaging/RELEASE_PACKAGING.md's "Planned, not yet built" section (corrected 2026-09-05; the doc previously described this fabricated pipeline as already shipped).
- [x] T8.2  Reproducible-build notes :: verify: build notes present
  - Note: the build notes this originally verified against (docs/packaging/RELEASE_PACKAGING.md) were themselves fabricated and have since been corrected to describe the real `.deb`/`.AppImage`-only pipeline.
- [ ] T8.3  Gate 4: human installs on real machine and runs onboarding
