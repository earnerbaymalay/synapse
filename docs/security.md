# Security Audit & Threat Model — SYNAPSE
### llm-neuro-surgeon — Local-First Security Architecture

This document details the security posture, threat model, and defense mechanisms implemented across SYNAPSE (`packages/core`).

---

## 1. Threat Model Overview

SYNAPSE operates local-first on developer workstations. It ingests configurations from local tools and Git repositories, storing them in `~/AIBrain`.

## 2. Core Security Controls

| Control | Mechanism | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| 🛡️ **Path Traversal Protection** | `safe_join()` | Normalizes all paths; rejects `..` components or escape attempts before writing. |
| 🔗 **Symlink Escape Defense** | `DirEntry::file_type()` | Uses `symlink_metadata()` without following symlinks during directory walks. |
| 🔑 **API Key Isolation** | OS Keychain | Raw keys live in OS Keychain (macOS Keychain / Secret Service / Credential Manager); configs use `${VAR}` placeholders. |
| 📜 **Marketplace Provenance** | SHA-256 Checksums | Every imported skill/agent contains SHA-256 content hashes and upstream Git commit metadata. |
| 🚫 **Zero Telemetry** | Local-First | Zero external analytics, phone-home, or remote tracking code. |

## 3. Path Traversal Defenses (`safe_join`)

> [!CAUTION]
> **Path Traversal Attacks:**  
> A malicious tool config could specify a rule filename like `../../.bashrc` to attempt overwriting system files outside the tool root.

`packages/core/src/adapters/mod.rs` implements `safe_join(root, relative)`.
It's a lexical check on `relative`'s path components — deliberately not
`canonicalize()`-based, since canonicalizing requires the target to
already exist on disk, which would break every write of a *new* file:

```rust
pub fn safe_join(root: &Path, relative: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, AdapterError> {
    let candidate = Path::new(relative);
    for component in candidate.components() {
        match component {
            Component::ParentDir | Component::RootDir | Component::Prefix(_) => {
                return Err(AdapterError::Malformed(format!(
                    "refusing to write outside the target root: {relative}"
                )));
            }
            Component::CurDir | Component::Normal(_) => {}
        }
    }
    Ok(root.join(candidate))
}
```

---

## 4. Symlink Loop Defenses

To prevent symlink loop denial-of-service (e.g. `a -> b -> a`) or escaping into sensitive system directories, directory recursion never follows a symlinked directory — it's skipped outright, not inspected:

```rust
if file_type.is_symlink() {
    continue;
}
```

There is no target-auditing step: a symlink encountered during a recursive
scan (see `packages/core/src/adapters/github_copilot.rs`) is simply not
descended into, which is what makes the defense immune to loops (`a -> b ->
a`) and escapes alike — the recursion never follows the pointer far enough
to hit either problem.

## 5. Security Audit Verification

All security mechanisms are verified by automated tests in `packages/core/tests/adapter_stress_tests.rs`:

```bash
cargo test -p neurosurgeon-core --test adapter_stress_tests
```

- `test_windsurf_adapter_path_traversal_and_missing`: **PASSED**
- `test_github_copilot_adapter_path_traversal_is_blocked`: **PASSED**
- `test_github_copilot_adapter_symlink_loop_does_not_hang`: **PASSED**
- `test_windsurf_adapter_writes_outside_root`: **PASSED**
